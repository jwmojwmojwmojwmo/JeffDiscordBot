Please use this GitHub for reporting any errors!

If there are any private questions/comments/concerns/suggestions you may have, please use the contact information on my profile - but only if absolutely necessary. If I start getting spammed or something then I will take down all my contact information, and you will NOT be able to contact me until I make a contact form on the website, which will probably be never ever because I hate making websites.

To run the bot locally:

Create your own ``quizquestions.js`` and ``config.json`` files, using the examples files as guidelines.

You can find token from the Discord Developer portal, all IDs from Discord developer mode, and API Keys from their respective websites.

Install dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

Deploy commands to Discord (neccesary when modifying command data)
